        <b>Welcome to the Communication in Human-AI Interaction Workshop</b>
        <br/>
        The goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together experts from AI, HCI, and Cognitive Sciences to explore and understand the specificities and characteristics of communication in human-AI interactions, as well as the salient principles, methods, and theories one has to consider to build meaningful human-AI communication systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        The workshop is hosted as part of the <a href="https://hhai-conference.org/2024/">HHAI 2024 Conference</a>.

        Human Interactions with AI systems are becoming part of our everyday life. If designed and developed efficiently, these interactions have great potential in enhancing human work, abilities, and well-being. In this workshop, we decide to take the particular viewpoint in which AI systems are not merely a tool for expression or communication, but in which they take the role of ``communicators'', meaning systems **with** which humans create shared meaning. This shift creates many new challenges and opportunities to design new ways for humans and AI systems to interact. For instance, such AI communicators may have the agency to initiate communication interactions, and should contribute to such interactions in an efficient way. 
        <br>
        We welcome short papers (6 pages excluding references) formatted using the [IOS formatting guidelines](https://www.iospress.com/book-article-instructions). Submissions will be done through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chai2024). Papers will be reviewed by the organizing committee based on their relevance to the workshop topics and interest in encouraging fruitful discussion.
        <br>
        We strongly encourage authors of papers to follow the [SIGCHI accessibility guidelines](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/).
        <br>
        Accepted papers will be published with [CEUR-WS](https://ceur-ws.org/), unless authors specify that they wish for the paper not be publicly available (request can be done by sending an email to jennifer.renoux@oru.se after notification of acceptance). 

        ## Topics
        Topics of interests include but are not limited to:
        - Concepts and theories of communication in human-AI interaction
        - Human-AI communication design
        - Blended social contexts, comprising both human and technological communication
        - Communication in multi-user interaction with intelligent agents
        - Embodied multi-modal human-AI communication (including physical robots)
        - Verbal and non-verbal human-AI communication
        - Communication for human-AI collaboration

        The primary goal of this workshop is to **bridge disciplinary boundaries** between various fields, included but not limited to AI, HRI, and HCI, in order to gather a multi-perspective view on the topic of Communication in Human-AI Interaction. In particular, we are interested in exploring the **core characteristics** of AI communicators and human-AI communication, exchanging research methods, and fostering long-term collaboration between practitioners of different fields. 
        <br>
        As the study of communication in human-AI interaction is by essence a multidisciplinary approach, we aim for this workshop to be a multidisciplinary platform where researchers can learn to work together and pave the way to impacting research.  We also wish to use this opportunity to draw a **tentative disciplinary map** of the topic of Communication in Human-AI Interaction, describing different perspectives, research directions, methods, and how these perspectives can be related to one another within the research area as a whole.

        The morning will focus on networking. First participants will introduce themselves, and participants who have a position paper accepted will present it in a round of lightning talks. After the keynote and the coffee break, we will organize a poster session for participant to discover each-others research. 
        The afternoon will be organized as a World Café where participants will reflect on topics related to Communication in Human-AI Interaction. Depending on the number of participants, we will hold between three and five rounds of discussion.
