Human interactions with AI systems are becoming part of our everyday life. If designed and developed efficiently, these interactions have great potential in enhancing human work, abilities, and well-being. Communication, here the iterative process of establishing shared meaning, is a crucial aspect of successful interaction and has been studied for years, from AI, HCI, and cognitive sciences points of view, among others.

We welcome papers presenting models, theories, and user studies across the topics of interest, as well as preliminary results and presentation of ongoing research.
