Ilaria Torre is an Assistant Professor in Human-Robot Interaction at Chalmers University of Technology. Previously, she was a postdoctoral researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and a Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellow at Trinity College Dublin, after obtaining her PhD from the University of Plymouth in 2017. Her research centers around improving communication between humans and robots. This includes both verbal (e.g. designing appropriate voices for robots) and nonverbal communication (e.g. investigating how sounds or other nonverbal signals can intuitively communicate information in cases where the robot cannot, or should not, use language).
