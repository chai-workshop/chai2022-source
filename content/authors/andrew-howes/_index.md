I am a Computer Scientist who is interested in the application of computational thinking to explaining human behaviour. I am also interested in how to design tools that help people make better decisions. I am currently Head of the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham. I am also an Associate Editor of Cognitive Science journal.
