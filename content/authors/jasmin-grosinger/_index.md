My research interests lie within the field of AI for autonomous agents in a real-world setting. Specifically I am interested in making robots proactive. By this I mean enabling them to infer their own goals and acting decisions, which they then pursue and achieve. The question of making robots proactive comprises a variety of different areas within AI, among others, goal reasoning, context awareness, automatic planning, action execution and monitoring. My work so far has been using knowledge-based models employing different flavors of logic.

I am currently a researcher in Computer Science at the Center for Applied Autonomous Systems (AASS) where I am part of the Cognitive Robotics Lab. I received my PhD in Computer Science at the Örebro University, Sweden, in December 2019. Previously, I finished my Master and Bachelor in Medical Informatics at the Technical University of Vienna, Austria. I conducted parts of  my undergraduate studies at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, and the University of Melbourne, Australia.
