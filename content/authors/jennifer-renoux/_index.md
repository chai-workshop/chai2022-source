I am a researcher in  in Human-Machine Teams and Human-Machine Communication at the Cognitive Robotics System lab, at Örebro University, Sweden. Humans and artificial systems have different capabilities, both in perception and action. Thus I strongly believe that autonomous systems have a tremendous potential to make human’s life better and easier, especially when working with them. For this reason, my primary research interest lies in collaborative AI and human-machine teams, especially human-machine communication. Some of the (many) questions I am currently asking myself are:

* How can an artificial system communicate efficiently to a human partner?

* How can an artificial system adapt to each humans individuality when it communicates?

* Can efficient communication improve human’s comfort and trust toward intelligent systems?

* How does efficient communication impact the performance of a human-machine team? 

Prior to joining Örebro University, I obtained in 2015 my Ph.D. from the University of Caen Normandy (France). I also hold a Master of Engineering in Computer Science from the National Institute of Applied Sciences (France) and a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making from the University Pierre and Marie Curie (France).
