Dr Marta Romeo is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science department in the School of MACS (Mathematical and Computer Sciences) at Heriot-Watt University. Her research focuses on developing social intelligent robots, adapting and personalising to their users for an increased acceptability and usability. She is interested in human-robot interaction, social robotics, affective computing, health and well-being. She got her bachelor and master's degrees in engineering of Computing Systems at Politecnico di Milano (Italy) and she moved to the UK to pursue a PhD in Computer Science. She got her PhD in 2020 from the University of Manchester on human-robot interaction and deep learning for companionship in elderly care, working in the H2020 Project MoveCare (Multiple-Actors Virtual Empathic Caregiver for the Elder). She then stayed at the University of Manchester as a postdoc (2020-2022) for the UKRI Node on Trust, working on how trust in huma-robot interaction is built, maintained and possibly recovered when lost.
