This workshop intends to be a **collaborative thinking group** about the challenges surrounding Communication in Human-AI Interaction. The workshop aims at being interactive and will consists of two main parts.

First, participants will be invited to collaborate on a **design activity**. For this activity, participants will be grouped as best as possible by topics and each group will be given the same challenge: analyzing and suggesting a solution to an HAI communication problem. At the end of the activity, each group will report on their solution. 

Second, we will have **group discussions** in two phases, for which groups will be shuffled to be cross-disciplinary. Each group will be given a separate topic. The goal of each group will be to identify **common interests, open questions, and challenges** related to this topic. The groups are shuffled between phases, and participants encouraged to build on top of the previous groupsâ€™ discussion. Each discussion phase will be followed by a quick report of each group. The day will end by a longer plenary discussion during which we will also outline the after-workshop steps .

The design activity problem and the discussion topics will be chosen following participants submissions so that they align with the expertise and interest of the workshop participants.

By the end of the workshop, we expect to be as close as possible to a **common agreement about an outline for the coordinated research agenda**, including key points to explore further. Post-workshop, the results will be communicated to a larger audience through various activities, to be synchronized with the participants.
